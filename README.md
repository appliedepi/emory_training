[This website](https://appliedepi.github.io/emory_training) hosts
training materials for the R demonstrations first delivered by **Applied
Epi** to 40 Rollins COVID-19 Epidemiology fellows and colleagues from
the [Emory COVID-19 Response
Collaborative](https://emorycovidcollaborative.org/) in August 2021.  
Links to the video recordings are available below and on our [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgXBQIFJ_Rmq3UhWL_yrkxQ/featured).

# The Emory COVID-19 Response Collaborative

<img src = "https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/raw/master/presentation/images/ECRC_full%20color.png" width = "800" height="200">

The [Emory COVID-19 Response
Collaborative](https://emorycovidcollaborative.org/projects/georgia-department-of-public-health/)
is an initiative led by the Emory Rollins School of Public Health in
collaboration with the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH). Its
mission is to provide academic support to state and local health
department partners during the COVID-19 crisis. One of its seminal
programs is the Rollins Epidemiology Fellows Program, a 2-year
fellowship designed to attract, place and support early-career
epidemiologists across Georgia’s 18 health districts and GDPH. With
assistance from ECRC leadership and the Fulton County Board of Health,
Applied Epi designed this tailored training session to build the
fellows’ analytic capabilities in R through examples tailored to their
applied needs in preparing jurisdictional COVID-19 outbreak reports and
maps.
