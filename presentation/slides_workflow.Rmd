# Today's session   

Today is primarily *explanation* and *demonstration*. 

We are going to assume basic understanding of *R* syntax. 

We also assume you have reviewed the Handbook pages on [R Basics](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html), [Cleaning data and core functions](https://epirhandbook.com/cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html), and [Reports with R markdown](https://epirhandbook.com/reports-with-r-markdown.html) 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  



???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question & answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching.

# Why R? 
### An appetizer for motivation 

---
# Flexibility 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/interoperability.png?raw=true)  


???
- R can read and write to loads of different software/databases.  
- Can also produce many different outputs  
- Save you time and headache (automated and reproducible workflows)  

---
# Popularity 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/r_popularity.png?raw=true)  


???
- R is free - and yet can do more than what expensive licensed software can  
- Most students in the US will have learnt SAS (but changing)  
- Previously limited to academic statisticians - R was not "trusted"  
- But now even pharma companies (e.g. GSK) and regulators are making the switch  
- It is the most widely used statistical programming language.

# Setting the scene 

- You are the local epi tasked with automating the weekly situation report  
  - We are going to reproduce [Fulton County epidemiology reports](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/covid-19/epidemiology-reports)  
  - We have pre-packaged an example **R-project** folder 
  - Walk-through from start to finish

---
# Setting the scene  
### Start with a new R project

- Create a project directory
  + File -> New Directory...

--

- R project directories can be shared easily

--
## TODO ADD IMG TO MASTER

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/make_proj.png?raw=true)

# Rmarkdown parameterisation  

- Rmd files use YAML header

- Use parameters to generalise reports for different scenarios
 + different dates
 + different counties
 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
params:
  as_of_date: 2021-08-01
  county: "Fulton"
```

- Acess parameters with `params$...`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# filter linelist for county of choice
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  filter(county == params$county)
```

# File paths & importing data  

#### Use the `{here}` and `{rio}` packages to import data


- `here::here()` to navigate working environment
 
--

- `rio::import()` to import a file
 
--





```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# import excel file from data folder
# use  sheet named **in**
raw_linelist <- rio::import(
  here::here("data", "covid_linelist.xlsx"), 
  which = "in"
)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# not sure we ACTUALLY need the data in but we'll see
linelist_raw <- here::here("case_study", "data",
                     "covid_example_data", "covid_example_data.xlsx") %>%
     # specify the sheet to read using which (default is to read first sheet)
     import(which = "in")

# Cleaning data  

#### Use `{dplyr}` to clean data

1. Visually inspect data (`summary()`, `glimpse()`)

--

2. Rename and choose fields (`select()`)

--

3. Parse and clean fields
 + parse dates (using `{lubridate}`)
 + clean categorical variables
 + clean numeric variables

--

4. Filter data and remove duplicates



.footnote[
See the [EpiRHandbook section on cleaning](https://epirhandbook.com/cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html)

and the [EpiRHandbook section on dates](https://epirhandbook.com/working-with-dates.html)
]

---
# Cleaning data
#### Example code


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist <- raw_linelist %>% 
  # choose variables
  select(date_birth, age, gender, zip_code, date_onset) %>% 
  # parse dates, clean gender, clean erroneous ages
  mutate(date_birth = ymd(dob),
         date_onset = ymd(date_onset),
         gender = str_to_title(gender),
         age = ifelse(age < 0, NA_integer_, age)) %>% 
  # remove recent data to account for lag
  filter(date_onset < Sys.Date() - weeks(2))

```

.footnote[
See the [EpiRHandbook section on cleaning](https://epirhandbook.com/cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html)

and the [EpiRHandbook section on dates](https://epirhandbook.com/working-with-dates.html)
]

---
# Cleaning data
#### Using `across()`

- We can use `dplyr::across()` to generalize cleaning operations

--

- Use within `dplyr::mutate()` and `dplyr::summarise()`

--
- General principle:
  + **Select** columns to work with
  + **Apply** generalised function

--

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist <- raw_linelist %>% 
  # choose variables
  select(date_birth, age, gender, zip_code, date_onset) %>% 
  # parse dates, clean gender, clean erroneous ages
  mutate(
    # apply to columns containing the string 'date'
    .cols = across(.cols = contains("date")),
    # apply as.Date() function to all selected columns
    .fns = ~as.Date(.x)
  ) 

```



---
# Merging data  

- We want to combine two tables (dataframes) with *common columns*

--

- Make sure values in common columns are aligned
  + Follow the principles of categorical variable cleaning
  + Use `dplyr::unique()`

--

- Use the correct join type from `{tidyr}` package
  + `tidyr::left_join()`
  + `tidyr::right_join()`
  + `tidyr::full_join()`
  + `tidyr::inner_join()`

# Descriptive analysis

- We want to produce descriptive *tables* and plots

--

- Group over key variable(s) to:
 + Calculate totals
 + Calculate percents

--

- Key packages:
 + `{janitor}`
 + `{dplyr}`
 + `{gtsummary}`
 

.footnote[

See the [EpiRHandbook section on descriptive tables](https://epirhandbook.com/descriptive-tables.html)

]
---

# Descriptive analysis

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

linelist %>% 
  # get counts and percentages 
  tabyl(gender) %>% 
  # add the overall counts as a row
  adorn_totals() %>%  
  # change from proportions to percentages (do not add a % sign)
  adorn_pct_formatting(affix_sign = FALSE)

  mutate(gender = replace_na(case_gender, "Unknown")) %>% 
  # get counts and percentages 
  tabyl(gender) %>% 
  # add the overall counts as a row

  # change from proportions to percentages (do not add a % sign)
  adorn_pct_formatting(affix_sign = FALSE) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

# Simple statistics

- R can perform many simple statistical tests out of the box
  
--

- Examples:
 + `t.test()` - _T-test_
 + `shapiro.test()` - _Shapiro-Wilk test_
 + `kruskal.test()` - _Kruskal-Wallis/Mann-Whitney U test_
 + `chisq.test()` - _Chi-Squared test_


.footnote[

See the [EpiRHandbook section on simple statistics](https://epirhandbook.com/simple-statistical-tests.html?q=stati#simple-statistical-tests)

]

---
# Simple stats



- In the context of summary tables we recommend `{gtsummary}`:

- Create summary tables, and add simple stats


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist %>% 
  # select variables of interest
  select(outcome, gender, age) %>% 
  # create summary table
  tbl_summary(by = outcome) %>%
  # add p-values from Chi-Sq test for gender and Kruskal-Wallis for age
  add_p(list(
    gender ~ "chisq.test",
    age ~ "kruskal.test")
  )

```


---
# Simple stats

#### An example output from previous code:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
linelist_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(died_covid), !is.na(case_gender), !is.na(case_age)) %>% 
  mutate(outcome = ifelse(died_covid == "Yes", "Died", "Recovered")) %>% 
  select(outcome, gender = case_gender, age = case_age) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = outcome) %>% 
  add_p(list(
    gender ~ "chisq.test",
    age ~ "kruskal.test")
  )

```

---
# Logistic regression

- We can also calculate ***odds ratios** via logistic regression

- It's crucial to establish reference values for each field!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist_reg <- linelist %>% 
  # select variables of interest
  select(outcome, gender, age, fever) %>% 
    # We don't want to consider 'Unknown' here
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), 
                ~fct_recode(.x, 
                            NULL = "Unknown"))) %>% 
  # set reference values
  mutate(
    outcome = fct_relevel(outcome, c("Recovered", "Died")),
    gender = fct_relevel(gender, c("Female", "Male", "Unknown")),
    fever = fct_relevel(fever, c("No", "Yes"))
  )
  
```

# Logistic rergression 

We recommend using `gtsummary::tbl_uvregression()` for this case:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
linelist_reg %>% 
  # create summary table
  tbl_uvregression(
    # define outcome variable
    y = outcome, 
    # define regression want to run (generalised linear model)
    method = glm, 
    # define what type of glm want to run (logistic)
    method.args = list(family = binomial), 
    # exponentiate to produce odds ratios (rather than log odds)
    exponentiate = TRUE, 
    # do not show the overall counts (this is done in cross_tab below)
    hide_n = TRUE

## Visualisation 

Note to selves: 
I think the way [this presentation](https://www.cedricscherer.com/slides/2019-08-28-intro-ggplot-statsizw#20) 
breaks down ggplots line by line is probably the way to go!

# Including images

.pull-left[
- Text displayed along side an image 
- May need to fiddle with sizes
  + position is %accross and %down 
  + size .... just flip a coin and see what comes out 
  + can also use % for images (see layout chunk just below YAML) 
    + i.e. in layout section up top to adds logos to each page (as per the twitter feed in [extras slide](#references))
- Can also include images with usual Rmarkdown or knitr code (e.g. next slide)

# Xaringan extra & fancy stuff 

- This is a good [tutorial](https://presentable-user2021.netlify.app/) from useR conference.
- You can include fancier code tabs i.e. this [pres](https://xaringan.gallery/examples.html) 
- Theres other fancy stuff in this [gallery](https://xaringan.gallery/examples.html)
- There is tips in this [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1085659933238976513)
  + e.g. if you name slides you can link back to them (nb. name needs to be first thing defined on slide)
  + keyboard shortcuts for presenting 
  + better side-by-side code example 
  + title page 
  + logos (have included this)
  + background images 
- Can set theme using [{xaringanthemer}](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer/articles/xaringanthemer.html) package 
  + seems easier than messing around with css

# Thanks!

Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```


---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).
