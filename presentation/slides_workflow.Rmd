# Today's session   

Today is primarily *explanation* and *demonstration*. 

We are going to assume basic understanding of *R* syntax. 

We also assume you have reviewed the Handbook pages on [R Basics](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html), [Cleaning data and core functions](https://epirhandbook.com/cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html), and [Reports with R markdown](https://epirhandbook.com/reports-with-r-markdown.html) 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  



???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question & answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching.

- R can read and write to loads of different software/databases.  
- Can also produce many different outputs

???
- R is free - and yet can do more than what expensive licensed software can  
- Most students in the US will have learnt SAS (but changing)  
- Previously limited to academic statisticians - R was not "trusted"  
- But now even pharma companies (e.g. GSK) and regulators are making the switch  
- It is the most widely used statistical programming language.

# Setting the scene  
#### Download our [example R project](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/tree/master/case_study)! (be sure to un-zip)


We created a dedicated R project, a directory containing:  

R project file (`case_study.Rproj`)  
  * `data/` folder  
    * `covid_example_data/` folder 
        * `covid_example_data.xlsx`  
        * `covid_shapefile/` folder  
          - `FultonCountryZipCode.shp`...
    * `map_tiles/` folder 
        * base map images for Fulton County...
  * `weekly_report.Rmd` (R markdown script)  
    * `template_style.docx`
    * `weekly_report.docx`
    * `weekly_report.md`
    * `weekly_report_files/` folder

# Rmarkdown parameterisation  

- Rmd files use YAML header

- Use parameters to generalise reports for different scenarios
 + different dates
 + different counties
 
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
params:
  as_of_date: 2021-08-01
  county: "Fulton"
```

- Access parameters with `params$...`

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# filter linelist for county of choice
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  filter(county == params$county)
```

# File paths

#### Use the `{here}` package to find files

.pull-left[
- *Relative* rather than *absolute* file-paths 
  - Better than `setwd()` for sharing
- Finds root directory automatically 
- Open `.Rproj` file first
- package::function() to avoid conflicts

# import excel file from data folder
# use  sheet named **in**
raw_linelist <- rio::import(

# import actual data for use in this slide deck

# Cleaning data  

#### Use `{dplyr}` to clean data

1. Visually inspect data (`View()`, `summary()`, `glimpse()`, `unique()`)

--

2. Rename and choose fields (`select()`)

--

3. Parse and clean fields
 + parse dates (using `{lubridate}`)
 + clean categorical variables
 + clean numeric variables

--

4. Filter data and remove duplicates



.footnote[
See the [EpiRHandbook section on cleaning](https://epirhandbook.com/cleaning-data-and-core-functions.html)

and the [EpiRHandbook section on dates](https://epirhandbook.com/working-with-dates.html)
]

# Cleaning data
#### Example code


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist <- raw_linelist %>% 
  
  # choose variables
  select(date_birth, date_report, age, gender, zip_code) %>% 
  
  # parse dates, clean gender, clean erroneous ages
  mutate(date_birth = ymd(date_birth),
         date_report = ymd(date_report),
         gender = str_to_title(gender),
         age = ifelse(age < 0, NA_integer_, age)) %>% 
  
  # remove recent data to account for lag
  filter(date_report < Sys.Date() - weeks(2))

```

and the [EpiRHandbook section on dates](https://epirhandbook.com/working-with-dates.html)
]

---
# Cleaning data
#### Using `across()`

- We can use `dplyr::across()` to generalize cleaning operations

--

- Use within `dplyr::mutate()` and `dplyr::summarise()`

--
- General principle:
  + **Select** columns to work with
  + **Apply** generalised function

--

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist <- raw_linelist %>% 
  # choose variables
  select(date_birth, date_report,  age, gender, zip_code) %>% 
  # parse dates, clean gender, clean erroneous ages
  mutate(across(
      # apply to columns containing the string 'date'
      .cols = contains("date"),  #<<
      # apply as.Date() function to all selected columns
      .fns = ~as.Date(.x)  #<<
    )) 
```



---
# Merging data  

- We want to combine two tables (dataframes) with *common columns*

--

- Make sure values in common columns are aligned exactly  
  + Follow the principles of categorical variable cleaning
  + Use `dplyr::unique()` to verify  
  
--

- Use the correct join type from `{tidyr}` package
  + `tidyr::left_join()`
  + `tidyr::right_join()`
  + `tidyr::full_join()`
  + `tidyr::inner_join()`

 + `{gtsummary}`

# Simple statistics

- R can perform many simple statistical tests out of the box
  
--

- Examples:
 + `t.test()` - _T-test_
 + `shapiro.test()` - _Shapiro-Wilk test_
 + `kruskal.test()` - _Kruskal-Wallis/Mann-Whitney U test_
 + `chisq.test()` - _Chi-Squared test_

# Simple stats



- In the context of summary tables we recommend `{gtsummary}`:

- Create summary tables, and add simple stats


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist %>% 
  # select variables of interest
  select(outcome, gender, age) %>% 
  
  # create summary table
  tbl_summary(by = outcome) %>%
  
  # add p-values from Chi-Sq test for gender and Kruskal-Wallis for age
  add_p(list(
    gender ~ "chisq.test",
    age ~ "kruskal.test")
  )

```


---
# Simple stats

#### An example output from previous code:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
linelist_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(died_covid), !is.na(case_gender), !is.na(case_age)) %>% 
  mutate(outcome = ifelse(died_covid == "Yes", "Died", "Recovered")) %>% 
  select(outcome, gender = case_gender, age = case_age) %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = outcome) %>% 
  add_p(list(
    gender ~ "chisq.test",
    age ~ "kruskal.test")
  )

```

---
# Logistic regression

- We can also calculate **odds ratios** via logistic regression

- It's crucial to establish **reference values** for each field!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

linelist_reg <- linelist %>%

  select(outcome, gender, age, fever) %>% 
  
  # We don't want to consider 'Unknown' here

# Logistic regression 

We recommend using `gtsummary::tbl_uvregression()` for this case:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
linelist_reg %>% 
  # create summary table
  tbl_uvregression(
    
    # define outcome variable
    y = outcome, 
    
    # define regression to run (generalised linear model)
    method = glm, 
    
    # define what type of glm to run (logistic)
    method.args = list(family = binomial), 
    
    # exponentiate to produce odds ratios (rather than log odds)
    exponentiate = TRUE, 
    
    # do not show the overall counts (this is done in cross_tab below)
    hide_n = TRUE
  )
```

# Logistic regression 

#### An example output from our previous code:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
linelist_raw %>% 
  filter(!is.na(died_covid), !is.na(case_gender), !is.na(case_age), !is.na(sym_fever),
         case_gender != "Unknown", sym_fever %in% c("Yes", "No")) %>% 
  mutate(outcome = ifelse(died_covid == "Yes", "Died", "Recovered")) %>% 
  select(outcome, gender = case_gender, age = case_age, fever = sym_fever) %>% 
  mutate(
    outcome = fct_relevel(outcome, c("Recovered", "Died")),
    gender = fct_relevel(gender, c("Female", "Male", "Unknown")),
    fever = fct_relevel(fever, c("No", "Yes"))
  ) %>% 
  tbl_uvregression(
    # define outcome variable
    y = outcome, 
    # define regression want to run (generalised linear model)
    method = glm, 
    # define what type of glm want to run (logistic)
    method.args = list(family = binomial), 
    # exponentiate to produce odds ratios (rather than log odds)
    exponentiate = TRUE, 
    # do not show the overall counts (this is done in cross_tab below)
    hide_n = TRUE
  )

```

# Thank you for your service  

We know personally how exhausting it is to work on COVID-19 response.  

**Thank you** for your dedication to public service and epidemiology in these trying and historic times.

We are seeking to make small improvements to the lives of epidemiologists
