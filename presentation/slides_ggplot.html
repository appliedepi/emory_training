# We are Applied Epi  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/epiRhandbook_eng/raw/master/images/Epi%20R%20Handbook%20Banner%20Beige%201500x500.png)

* We are a grassroots collaborative of applied epidemiologists  
* Our (free) **Epi R Handbook** has been used by 40,000 people worldwide
* Now we offer customized training to health departments and NGOs  


.footnote[Bookmark [www.epiRhandbook.com](www.epirhandbook.com)!]  


???
- What makes us different is that we focus on the challenges of applied epi, not academic epi. We emphasize the skills used every day by ground-level epidemiologists.

# Today's session   

Today is primarily *explanation* and *demonstration*, following from the previous [demonstration on data management and workflow](https://appliedepi.github.io/emory_training/presentation/slides.html).  

We assume you have reviewed the Handbook pages on [R Basics](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html) and [ggplot basics](https://epirhandbook.com/ggplot-basics.html).  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  




???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question &amp; answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching.

# Outline

1) Setting the scene (directory, packages, data import)  
2) Fundamentals of ggplot  
3) Bar charts  
4) Epidemic curves  
5) Demographic pyramids  
6) Scatter plots  
7) Plot captions  

The Epi R Handbook contains more examples and more complex plots, for your personal reading

# Visualization options in R  

Today we focus on **ggplot2** because:  

* It is good for fast data exploration of multi-dimensional data  
* It produces very high quality final outputs  
* Is accompanied by many packages that expand functionality  
* Has well-structured grammar = consistency  

Other plotting options include [**base** R](https://towardsdatascience.com/base-plotting-in-r-eb365da06b22), [**lattice**](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html), and [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/).  












---
# Setting the scene - directory structure  

Our R work is conducted within a dedicated directory that contains:  

* An R project (optional but advised)  
* R markdown scripts  
* A data folder  

* R project (`case_study.Rproj`)  
  * `data/` folder  
    * `covid_example_data/` folder
      * `covid_example_data.xlsx`  
      * `covid_shapefile/` folder  
        - `FultonCountryZipCode.shp`...
  * `scripts/` folder  
    * `ggplot_demo.Rmd`










---
# Load packages  

**ggplot2** is included within the **tidyverse** mega-package (read more [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).  


```r
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            # import/export
  here,           # file locator
  rmarkdown,      # reports
  lubridate,      # working with dates
  tidyverse       # mega-package for data management and visualization
  )
```

The **tidyverse** also includes these packages:  
* **dplyr** (data management)  
* **stringr** (characters and text)  
* **forcats** (factors / ordered categories)  
* and many others...  








---

# Import data

We use a *clean* dataset, to focus on visualization techniques.  

* Use `import()` from **rio** to import a file  
* Use `here()` from **here** to locate the file relative to the R project root




```r
linelist_raw &lt;- import(here("case_study", "data", "covid_example_data", "covid_example_data.xlsx"))
```

*Note: The `import()` function can import almost any kind of file. A .rds file stores an R data frame and retains column classes*

# Fundamentals of ggplot2





---
# gg-what??  

- The **ggplot2** *package* is the most popular data visualization tool in R  
- Its `ggplot()` *function* is at the core of the package  
- This whole approach is colloquially known as “ggploting”  
- Resulting figures are sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”  

**ggplot2** benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that extends its functionalities, such as **gganimate**, **ggthemr**, **ggdendro**, **gghighlight**, **ggforce**...  

.footnote[
Question: What does the "gg” in these names represent?
]

???
- "gg" represents the “grammar of graphics” used to construct the figures 





---
# Syntax overview  

Build a plot object by “adding” commands that specify plot layers and design elements on top of one another  
 

--

Order of layers will usually look like this:

1) **"Open" the plot** with the `ggplot()` command and specify the dataset  

--

2) **Add (`+`) “geom” layers** that visualize data geometrically as shapes  

--

3) **"Map" data columns** to features of the plot such as axes, color, size, shape, fill, transparency  


--

4) **Modify "scales"**, such as a color scale  

--

5) **Add design elements** such as axis labels, title, fonts, text sizes, background themes, or axes rotation  

--

All these layers are "added" sequentially with a `+` symbol  







---
# Syntax - open the plot  

.pull-left[

`ggplot()` creates an empty canvas.  
Assign the data frame to use.  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist)                   
```

Alternatively, use the `%&gt;%` pipe operator to "pipe" a data frame *into* `ggplot()`  


```r
linelist %&gt;%
  ggplot()
```

]

.pull-right[

] 

???
This is only a blank canvas, we have not defined what should be in the x and y axes. 
If several data frames are needed, they can be added in their own geoms.
Piping is useful to make one-time changes to a dataset prior to plotting.  





---
# Geometries  

.pull-left[

Data are visualized using "geom" commands, such as `geom_point()`.  

Some classical “geoms” include:  

Geometry        |Geom                
----------------|--------------------
Histograms      |`geom_histogram()`
Points          |`geom_point()`  
Lines           |`geom_line()`  
Box plots       |`geom_boxplot()`  
Bar charts      |`geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`  
Trend lines     |`geom_smooth()`  

Full list [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)

# Plot aesthetics  

.pull-left[

What else is missing from this command to create a scatter plot (points)?  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_point()
```

**What columns should be used for axes?**  

**How should the points be colored, shaped, etc?**  

These are the plot's "aesthetics"

# Mapping aesthetics with `aes()`  

.pull-left[

`mapping = aes()` is a `ggplot()` argument that assigns columns to plot "aesthetics" - features *whose display could vary for each data point* (position, color, shape...)  

It is unique in that its inputs must be placed within `aes()`.  

Two basic aesthetic mappings are the axes: `x=` and `y=`.  


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(x = age, y = days_hosp)
  )
```

# A quick note on indentations  

Indentations, spaces, and newlines do not impact code execution, and can be varied to improve readability.  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = days_hosp))+
  geom_point()
```

is the same as:  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(x = age, y = days_hosp))+
  geom_point()
```

is the same as:  


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,        # use case linelist
  mapping = aes(          # make aesthetic mappings for all geoms
    x = age,              # assign x-axis to age column
    y = days_hosp))+      # assign y-axis to duration of hospitalization
geom_point()              # display data as points
```



???
- Explain why you might use one or the other 
long style can enable informative comments/annotations  










---
# Aesthetic mapping placement  

* Mappings written in `ggplot()` apply to all geoms (e.g. axes)  
* Mappings written within one geom apply only to it  


```r
ggplot(                     # open the plot 
  data = linelist,            # set dataset 
* mapping = aes(              # map axes to columns
*   x = age,
*   y = days_hosp))+
  geom_point()              # plot points
```

is the same as:  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist)+    # open plot and set dataset
  geom_point(               # plot points
*    mapping = aes(           # map axes to columns
*      x = age,
*      y = days_hosp))
```

(but only because there is only one geom)  


???
- Explain why you might use one or the other  








---
# Overplotting  

.pull-left[

With axes now mapped, the `geom_point()` displays the data as points


```r
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(
         x = age,
         y = onset_hosp))+
*  geom_point()
```

This plot is difficult to interpret because points may be overlapping.  

*tip: try `geom_jitter()` to slightly offset all points*

# Adding geoms

Additional geoms can be added on top  


```r

       mapping = aes(
         x = age,
         y = days_hosp))+
  geom_point()+
* geom_smooth()

`geom_smooth()` gives smoothed conditional means, helping to show trends in presence of "over-plotting" (see [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html)).

# Other aesthetics

Aside from axes, other common "aesthetics" include: 

Geometry        |Geom                
----------------|--------------------
`shape = `      |Display point as dot, star, triangle, square...
`fill =  `      |The *interior* color (e.g of bar or boxplot)  
`color = `      |The *exterior* or bar, boxplot - OR point color  
`size = `       |Line thickness, point size...
`alpha = `      |Transparency (1 = opaque, 0 = invisible)
`width = `      |Width of "bar plot" bars
`linetype = `   |Either solid, dashed, dotted, etc.  
`binwidth = `   |Width of histogram bins

Note that “aesthetic” in ggplot has a specific meaning that you might associate with the word “aesthetics” in common English. In ggplot those details are called “themes” and are adjusted within a theme() command

Each geom accepts certain aesthetics, like `binwidth=` for `geom_histogram()`

# Other aesthetics  



.pull-left[

These aesthetics can be assigned to either:  

* **Static values** (`color = "yellow"`)  
  - Assigned *outside* `aes()`  
* **A data column** (`aes(fill = died)`)  
  - Assigned *inside* `aes()`
  - Displays data as "groups"  
  

For example, below, point shape will vary by outcome (the value in column `died`), but every point is colored yellow.   


```r
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(x = age, y = days_hosp))+
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(shape = died),
    color = "yellow")
```

---
# Static aesthetics  

.pull-left[

An aesthetic is *static*, applying to all data points, if it is assigned to a number or character value and written *outside* `aes()`  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(
         x = age,
         y = days_hosp))+ 
*geom_point(color = "seagreen")
```

Other examples:  
`size = 3`  
`transparency = 0.5`  
`width = 1.2`  

]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="slides_ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
] 






---
# Dynamic aesthetics   

.pull-left[

An aesthetic is *dynamic*, varying for each data point, if it assigned to a *column name* and written *inside* `aes()`    


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age,
    y = days_hosp))+   
geom_point(
* mapping = aes(color = died))
```

*Note: `color = died` could also be written in `ggplot()`'s `aes()`.*
]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="slides_ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

???

In the next slide, the color = died will appear in the ggplot()'s aes() command for simplicity.
This works because there is only one geom and the geom_point will inherit the color mapping.  



---
# Multiple aesthetics - example  

.pull-left[

Both static and dynamic aesthetics: 


```r
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = age,
      y = days_hosp,
*     color = died),  # color varies by outcome
*   size = 3)         # all points 3x size
```


]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="slides_ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

???

As there is only one geom, all aesthetics can be writtein `ggplot()`, or in `geom_point()`



---
# Scales - overview  

Scale commands control *how* the aesthetic mappings manifest, for example:  
* *Which* colors or shapes to display  
* The min/max of point sizes  
* The min/max and frequency of axes breaks  

To replace the defaults, add a `scale_` command. As a generic formula, these commands are written as `scale_AESTHETIC_METHOD()`.  

1) `scale_` : this prefix never changes  
2) Aesthetics like: `_fill_` , `_color_` , `_x_` , `_y_` , etc.  
3) Methods like: `_continuous()`, `_discrete()`, `_manual()`, `_date()` etc.

Inside the command, use arguments such as `breaks=`, `values=`, or `labels=` (there are many possibilities).  


---
# Scales examples  

Some examples of scale commands:  

You want to adjust  |Scale command
--------------------|-------------------

# Scales - default

# Label tips  

See the [Epi R Handbook page](https://epirhandbook.com/characters-and-strings.html#dynamic-strings) on adjusting characters with the **stringr** package

**New lines**  
Use `\n` within the string to bump to a new line, or place the text in [`str_wrap()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_wrap.html) and specify the number of characters to wrap at.  


```r
title = str_wrap("This is a really long title", 30)
```

**Dynamic labels**  
Use `str_glue()` to imbed R code that updates with the data.  


```r
caption = str_glue("Data as of {Sys.Date()}"))
```


```r
caption = str_glue("{nrow(linelist %&gt;% filter(is.na(date_onset)))} cases missing date of onset and not shown"))
```

**Legend title**  
In `labs()`, write the aesthetic that created the legend, like `fill=`, `color=`, or `shape=`, and provide a title.  



???
Explain that in str_glue, anything within curly brackets it will run as R code.

# Make an epicurve  

Two approaches that we suggest:  

1) Use the **incidence2** package  
  * Fast, simple, and modifiable with ggplot additions  
  
2) Use ggplot's `geom_histogram()`  
  * Most customizeability  
  * Most complex code

# Show groups  

So far the graph shows the distribution of cases in all hospitals. 

It would make sense to break down the visualization by hospitals.

Two options:  

* Fill each hospital in different color (stacked histogram)
* Create multiple plots, each showing a different hospital



---
# Color by group

.pull-left[

To color by group (stacked epicurve), we need to map the variable `eth_race` to the `fill=` aesthetic *in* the `aes()`:  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(
         x    = date_onset,
*        fill = eth_race))+
  geom_histogram()
```

Note: the _fill_ aesthetics control the color filling areas while the _color_ aesthetics control the color of lines and points.

# Bar plots  

`geom_col()` and `geom_bar()` are used to make general bar plots (non-epicurves).

Use `geom_bar()` if bar height should reflect the number of rows in the data (e.g. a case linelist).  


```r
ggplot(linelist)+            # begin with linelist       
*  geom_bar(
     mapping = aes(x = eth_race)) # one bar per race/ethnicity. No y= argument. 
```

Use `geom_col()` if the data have a numeric column containing the desired bar height (i.e. aggregated count data).  


```r
ggplot(linelist_agg)+    # begin with aggregated count data            
*  geom_col(
    mapping = aes(x = eth_race, y = n))   # bar height is value in column "n"
```
