# We are Applied Epi  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/epiRhandbook_eng/raw/master/images/Epi%20R%20Handbook%20Banner%20Beige%201500x500.png)

* We are a grassroots collaborative of applied epidemiologists  
* Our (free) **Epi R Handbook** has been used by 60,000 people worldwide
* Now we offer customized training to health departments and NGOs  


.footnote[Bookmark [www.epiRhandbook.com](www.epirhandbook.com)!]  


???
- What makes us different is that we focus on the challenges of applied epi, not academic epi. We emphasize the skills used every day by ground-level epidemiologists.

# Today's demonstration  

Today is primarily *explanation* and *demonstration*, following from the previous [demonstration on data management and workflow](https://appliedepi.github.io/emory_training/presentation/slides_workflow.html).  

We assume you have reviewed the Handbook pages on [R Basics](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html) and [ggplot basics](https://epirhandbook.com/ggplot-basics.html).  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  




???
- Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question &amp; answer session.  
- We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session.  
- We also offer training in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching.

# Objectives  

Our objectives today are to:  

1) De-mystify `ggplot()` syntax so you can apply it to your own tasks  
2) Demonstrate core `geom_()` commands  
3) Introduce helpful "wrapper" packages like **incidence2** and **apyramid**  
4) Touch upon advanced tips with packages **ggExtra**, **ggrepel**, **gghighlight**, **scales**, **plotly**, and **esquisse**  


.footnote[The [Epi R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/index.html) contains many more examples.]  



???
- 1 - core syntax and 2 - exposure
- Ready yourself because today will be a whirlwind.
- There will be a LOT of content and we will move quickly.
- Type questions in the chat, or hold them to the end.  
- We will do understanding checks throughout

# Resources for you  

Today's work is within an R project, which can be [downloaded as a zipped file](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/tree/master/case_study).  

Today's code is available to you in `ggplot_demo.Rmd` (also online [here](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/case_study/ggplot_demo.Rmd)).  

R project file (`case_study.Rproj`)  
  * `data/` folder  
    * `covid_example_data/` folder 
        * `linelist_cleaned.rds` 
        * `covid_example_data.xlsx`  
        * `covid_shapefile/` folder  
          - `FultonCountryZipCode.shp`...
    * `map_tiles/` folder 
        * base map images for Fulton County...
  * `ggplot_demo.Rmd` (R markdown script)  


???
- Do NOT download and try it now. Too distracting.  
- Today will move fast, but just like last time the REAL opportunity for you is to review at your own pace.  
- We've spent a lot of time developing materials for you.  
- SHOW SCRIPT AND OUTPUT IN FOLDER

# Load packages and import data  

Load packages (**ggplot2** is within [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/)) and import the cleaned (fake) dataset from [last session](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/case_study/weekly_report.Rmd).  


```r
## install and load necessary packages 
pacman::p_load(
  rio,        # importing data  
  here,       # relative file pathways  
  skimr,      # review data
  DT,         # visualize data frame
  janitor,    # data cleaning and tables
  epikit,     # age categories
  lubridate,  # working with dates
  incidence2, # epidemic curves
  ggrepel,    # smart labels
  ggExtra,    # extras
  esquisse,   # point-and-click for simple ggplots
  apyramid,   # age pyramids
  scales,     # formatting of scales
  plotly,     # interactive plots
  cowplot,    # combine plots
* tidyverse   # ggplot2 &amp; data management
)
```




```r
linelist &lt;- import(here::here("data", "covid_example_data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```


???
One tip is to load tidyverse last to avoid masking of package names  
The `import()` function can import almost any kind of file. An `.rds` file retains column classes from an R data frame.

# Visualization options in R  

Today we focus on **ggplot2** because it:  

* is good for fast data exploration of multi-dimensional data  
* produces very **high quality** final outputs  
* has well-structured grammar =&gt; **high consistency**  
* is accompanied by many packages that expand functionality  

See the [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) for inspiration.  

.footnote[Other plotting options include [**base** R](https://towardsdatascience.com/base-plotting-in-r-eb365da06b22), [**lattice**](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html), and [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/).]

# gg-what??  

--

- The **ggplot2** *package* is the most popular data visualization tool in R  

--

- Its `ggplot()` *function* is at the core of the package  

--

- This whole approach is colloquially known as “ggplotting”  

--

- Resulting figures are sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”  

--

**ggplot2** benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that extends its functionalities, such as **gganimate**, **ggthemr**, **ggdendro**, **gghighlight**, **ggforce**...  

.footnote[
*Bonus question:* What does the "gg” in these names represent?
]

???
- "gg" represents the “grammar of graphics” used to construct the figures

# Syntax overview  

Build a plot object by “adding” commands on top of one another that specify plot layers and design elements  


--

The order of layers will usually look like this:

1) **"Open" the plot** with the `ggplot()` command and specify the dataset  

--

2) **"Map" data columns** to "aesthetic" features of the plot such as axes, color, size, shape, fill, transparency  

--

3) **Add (`+`) “geom” layers** that visualize data geometrically as shapes  

--

4) **Modify "scales"**, such as a color scale or y-axis breaks  

--

5) **Add "theme" plot design elements** such as axis labels, title, caption, fonts, text sizes, background themes, or axes rotation  

--

These layers are "added" sequentially with `+` symbols.  
**ggplot2** commands can be quite long!  


???
Remember that although the commands may be long, it is infinitely easier to edit and recycle than in Excel

# Open the plot  

.pull-left[

`ggplot()` creates an empty canvas. Assign the data frame to use.  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist)                   
```

Alternatively, use the `%&gt;%` pipe operator to "pipe" a data frame *into* `ggplot()`  


```r
linelist %&gt;%
  ggplot()
```

]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="slides_ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
] 

???
This is only a blank canvas, we have not defined what should be in the x and y axes. 
If several data frames are needed, they can be added in their own geoms.
Piping is useful to make one-time changes to a dataset prior to plotting.

# Mappings with `aes()`  

.pull-left[


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
* mapping = aes(
*  x = age,
*  y = days_hosp))
```

"Aesthetics" are features *whose display could vary for each data point* (position, color, shape...)  

`mapping = aes()` assigns plot "aesthetics" to columns in the data. Inputs must be placed within `aes()`.  

Two basic aesthetic mappings are axes, via `x=` and `y=`.

.pull-left[


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age,
    y = days_hosp)) +
*geom_point()
```

Data are visualized using "geom" commands, such as `geom_point()`.  

These commands are "added" with a `+` to the `ggplot()` command.

Indentations, spaces, and newlines do not impact code execution, and can be varied to improve readability.  


```r

long style can enable informative comments/annotations
- short style very dense (harder to read for some). Shorter scripts, but so what? The number of lines of your code is not an informative metric.
- very long lines =&gt; needs to scroll horizontally for people with smaller monitors (not nice)
- long-ish style makes it easier to see which argument belongs to each function
- spaces around "=" or "+" =&gt; make it easier to parse to many people
- other?

# Other aesthetics  

Aside from axes, other common "aesthetics" include: 

Argument        |Controls                
----------------|-----------------------
`shape`      |Display of point as dot, star, triangle, square...
`fill`       |The *interior* color (e.g of bar or boxplot)  
`color`      |The *exterior* or bar, boxplot - OR point color  
`size`       |Line thickness, point size...
`alpha`      |Transparency: 0 (invisible) to 1 (opaque) 
`width`      |Width of "bar plot" bars
`linetype`   |Either solid, dashed, dotted, etc.  
`binwidth`   |Width of histogram bins  
  


???

Note that “aesthetic” in ggplot has a specific meaning that you might associate with the word “aesthetics” in common English. In ggplot those details are called “themes” and are adjusted within a theme() command

Each geom accepts certain aesthetics, like `binwidth=` for `geom_histogram()`

# Aesthetics assignments  


.pull-left[

Aesthetics can be assigned to either:  

* **Static values**: `color = "purple"`  
  - Assigned *outside* `aes()`  
  - Same display for all data  

* **A data column**: `aes(color = died)`  
  - Assigned *inside* `aes()`
  - Displays data as "groups"

```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age,
    y = days_hosp)) + 
*geom_point(color = "seagreen")
```


An aesthetic is *static* if it applies the same display to all data points in the geom or plot. Static aesthetics are defined *outside* `aes()` to a *number or character value*.  

Other examples:  
`size = 3`  
`alpha = 0.5`  
`width = 1.2`

```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age,
    y = days_hosp,
*   color = died)) +
geom_point()
```


*Dynamic* aesthetics are mapped to a column name, and defined *inside* `aes()`. This creates "groups" in the plot and generates a legend. The display varies for each data point.  

Above, `color=` is mapped to column `died`, and is inherited by `geom_point()`.

* alpha = 0.7) 
```

Above, `size = 7` and `alpha = 0.7` are static aesthetics defined outside any `aes()` and apply to `geom_point()`.  

`color=` is within an `aes()`, and maps to values in column `died`.

1) Dynamic mappings in the initial `ggplot()` call will apply to subsequent geoms, *unless otherwise indicated*  
2) Static aesthetics (e.g. `color = "blue"`) are not inherited by subsequent geoms  
3) Mappings written within one geom apply only to that geom

If your data are "grouped", yet you plot indiscriminately without the grouping assigned to a dynamic aesthetic, you get multiple y values per x value.  

Below, `linelist` is aggregated into counts per unique week-outcome.  


```r
outcome_week_data &lt;- linelist %&gt;% 
* count(died,
*       week_onset = floor_date(
*         x = date_onset,

  select(week_onset, everything()) %&gt;%

# Scales - overview  

Scale commands replace defaults of *how* the aesthetic mappings manifest, such as:  
* *Which* colors or shapes to display  
* The min/max of point sizes  
* The min/max and frequency of axes breaks  

As a generic formula, these commands are written as: **`scale_AESTHETIC_METHOD()`**.  

1) `scale_` : this prefix never changes  
2) AESTHETIC: `_fill_` , `_color_` , `_x_` , `_y_` , etc.  
3) METHOD: `_continuous()`, `_discrete()`, `_manual()`, `_date()`, etc.

# Bar plot - a common error 

.pull-left[

If your data look like below (counts) and your plot looks like that (bars of same height), ensure you are using `geom_col()` and not `geom_bar()`!

# Bar plot - flip axes

It is simple to flip the axes on any ggplot by adding `coord_flip()`  

This is useful in bar plot to improve readability.

theme(legend.position = "top") +

Use the **forcats** package to convert to class *factor* and adjust "level" order.  

Above, `fct_infreq()` orders x-axis position and stacks (fill) by frequency.

# Make an epidemic curve  

Two approaches that we suggest:  

1) Use the **incidence2** package  
  * Fast, simple, and modifiable with ggplot additions  
  
2) Use ggplot's `geom_histogram()`  
  * Most customizeability  
  * Most complex code

# Demographic pyramids  

We suggest two ways to make age pyramids:  

1) Use the **apyramid** package - simple, easy  

2) Use **ggplot2** - more customizeable, but opportunity for error  


Today we will demonstrate **apyramid**.

# Dynamic labels example

Let's use dynamic labels that will update with the data.  




**Simple caption**

```r
str_glue("n = {nrow(linelist)}")
```

```
## n = 81757
```


--

**Complex caption**  


For complicated `str_glue()` scenarios, define the dynamic components outside the quotation marks.  

`fmt_count()` from **epikit** is useful to count and display rows.  


```r
str_glue("{missing} missing age or gender not shown.",
        missing = fmt_count(linelist, is.na(gender) | is.na(age_group))
        )
```

```
## 405 (0.5%) missing age or gender not shown.
```



---
# Dynamic labels example


**Subtitle**  

Max/Min dates can be wrapped in `format()` from **base** to adjust the display. See the epiRhandbook section on [strptime syntax](https://epirhandbook.com/working-with-dates.html?q=strptime#format).  


```r
str_glue("Fulton County, reported {min_date} - {max_date}",
    min_date = format(min(linelist$date_report, na.rm=T), "%B %d %Y"),
    max_date = format(max(linelist$date_report, na.rm=T), "%B %d %Y")
    )
```

## Fulton County, reported January 03 2020 - June 23 2021

# Dual-axis - plot 1

You can also use **cowplot** to overlap two plots and create a "dual-axis" plot.  

Define the first plot:  


```r
plot1 &lt;- ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
    x = date_report)) + 
geom_histogram(color = "grey",
               alpha = 0.5) +

  date_breaks = "months",
  labels = scales::label_date_short(),
  expand = c(0, 0),
  name = "") +
scale_y_continuous(
  expand = c(0,0),
  name   = "Weekly reported case incidence")

# Data structure  

**ggplot2** works best when the dataset is in "long" format, where each variable has its own column. We recommend that you become familiar with `pivot_longer()` from **dplyr** (see the [Epi R Handbook pivoting page](https://epirhandbook.com/pivoting-data.html)).

# Basemaps 

- A screenshot of the map area 
- Called tiles 
  - Smaller images pieced together 
- Added for context (bottom layer of *ggplot*)
- A lot of different tile servers 
- A lot of different R packages 
  - We demonstrate [{ggspatial}](https://paleolimbot.github.io/ggspatial/)
    - Able to save tiles for offline use 
    - Also have scalebars
