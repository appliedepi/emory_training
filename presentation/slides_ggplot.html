# We are Applied Epi  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/epiRhandbook_eng/raw/master/images/Epi%20R%20Handbook%20Banner%20Beige%201500x500.png)

* We are a grassroots collaborative of applied epidemiologists  
* Our (free) **Epi R Handbook** has been used by 50,000 people worldwide
* Now we offer customized training to health departments and NGOs  


.footnote[Bookmark [www.epiRhandbook.com](www.epirhandbook.com)!]  


???
- What makes us different is that we focus on the challenges of applied epi, not academic epi. We emphasize the skills used every day by ground-level epidemiologists.

# Today's session   

Today is primarily *explanation* and *demonstration*, following from the previous [demonstration on data management and workflow](https://appliedepi.github.io/emory_training/presentation/slides.html).  

We assume you have reviewed the Handbook pages on [R Basics](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html) and [ggplot basics](https://epirhandbook.com/ggplot-basics.html).  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  




???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question &amp; answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching. 


---
# Outline

Today's demonstration will include:  

* Setting the scene (directory, packages, data import)  
* Fundamentals of ggplot  
* Data structure for **ggplot2**  
* Scatter plots  
* Bar plots  
* Dynamic labels and captions  
* Smart text labels for data  
* Epidemic curves with **incidence2**    
* Demographic pyramids with **apyramid**  
* Highlighting with **gghighlight**  
* Advanced tips such as **scales** and **gganimate**  


The Epi R Handbook contains more examples and more complex plots, for your personal reading  







---
# Visualization options in R  

Today we focus on **ggplot2** because:  

* It is good for fast data exploration of multi-dimensional data  
* It produces very high quality final outputs  
* Is accompanied by many packages that expand functionality  
* Has well-structured grammar = consistency  

Other plotting options include [**base** R](https://towardsdatascience.com/base-plotting-in-r-eb365da06b22), [**lattice**](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html), and [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/).  












---
# Directory structure  

Today's R work is conducted within a dedicated R project, which is a directory that contains:  

R project file (`case_study.Rproj`)  
  * `data/` folder  
    * `covid_example_data.xlsx`  
    * `covid_shapefile/` folder  
      - `FultonCountryZipCode.shp`...
  * `ggplot_demo.Rmd` (R markdown script)  
  
Read more in [this Epi R Handbook page](https://epirhandbook.com/r-projects.html) about best-practices using R projects and the **here** package.  










---
# Load packages  

**ggplot2** is included within the **tidyverse** mega-package (read more [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).  


```r
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            # import/export
  here,           # file locator
  lubridate,      # working with dates
  incidence2,     # epidemic curves
  apyramid,       # demographic pyramids
  gghighlight,    # specialized highlight plots
  ggrepel,        # smart labels
* tidyverse       # mega-package for data management and visualization
  )
```

The **tidyverse** also includes these packages useful for plots:  
* **dplyr** (data management)  
* **stringr** (characters and text)  
* **forcats** (factors / ordered categories)  
* and many others...  


???
One tip is to load tidyverse last to avoid masking of package names  





---

# Import data

Today we begin with a clean dataset in order to focus on visualization techniques.  

* Use `import()` from **rio** to import a file  
* Use `here()` from **here** to locate the file relative to the R project root




```r
linelist_raw &lt;- import(here::here("data", "covid_example_data.xlsx"))
```


.footnote[The `import()` function can import almost any kind of file. If using the example data, adjust this file path according to your directory structure
]

class: remark-code

# Clean data  

See the R markdown script from the previous session for all the cleaning code.  

We will not linger on data cleaning today, in the interest of time.  

We will touch upon data structure and pivoting later in the presentation.

# Fundamentals of ggplot2





---
# gg-what??  

--

- The **ggplot2** *package* is the most popular data visualization tool in R  

--

- Its `ggplot()` *function* is at the core of the package  

--

- This whole approach is colloquially known as “ggploting”  

--

- Resulting figures are sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”  

--

**ggplot2** benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that extends its functionalities, such as **gganimate**, **ggthemr**, **ggdendro**, **gghighlight**, **ggforce**...  

.footnote[
Bonus question: What does the "gg” in these names represent?
]

???
- "gg" represents the “grammar of graphics” used to construct the figures 





---
# Syntax overview  

Build a plot object by “adding” commands on top of one another that specify plot layers and design elements  


--

The order of layers will usually look like this:

# Syntax - open the plot  

.pull-left[

`ggplot()` creates an empty canvas. Assign the data frame to use.  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist)                   
```

Alternatively, use the `%&gt;%` pipe operator to "pipe" a data frame *into* `ggplot()`  


```r
linelist %&gt;%
  ggplot()
```

This is only a blank canvas, we have not defined what should be in the x and y axes. 
If several data frames are needed, they can be added in their own geoms.
Piping is useful to make one-time changes to a dataset prior to plotting.

# Mappings with `aes()`  

.pull-left[


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age,
    y = days_hosp)
)
```

`mapping = aes()` is a `ggplot()` argument that assigns plot "aesthetics" to columns in the data. It is special in that its inputs must be placed within `aes()`.  

"Aesthetics" are features *whose display could vary for each data point* (position, color, shape...)  

Two core aesthetic mappings are assigning columns for axes positioning: `x=` and `y=`.

*tip: try `geom_jitter()` to slightly offset all points*

# Aesthetics assignments  


.pull-left[

These aesthetics can be assigned to either:  

* **Static values** (`color = "yellow"`)  
  - Assigned *outside* `aes()`  
* **A data column** (`aes(fill = died)`)  
  - Assigned *inside* `aes()`
  - Displays data as "groups"  
  

For example, below, point shape will vary by outcome (the value in column `died`), but every point is colored yellow.   


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
     x = age,
     y = days_hosp,
*     shape = died))+
*geom_point(color = "yellow")
```

```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(
    x = age,
    y = days_hosp))+ 
*geom_point(color = "seagreen")
```


An aesthetic is *static*, applying the same display to all data points, if it is assigned to a number or character value and written *outside* `aes()`.  

Other examples:  
`size = 3`  
`transparency = 0.5`  
`width = 1.2`

```r
ggplot(

```


An aesthetic is *dynamic*, varying for each data point, if it assigned to a *column name* and written *inside* an `aes()`.  

Above, `color=` is mapped to column `died`, and is inherited by `geom_point()`.

    y = days_hosp,
*   color = died))+   # color by outcome
*geom_point(size = 7) # all points 7x size 
```

Above, `size = 7` is a static aesthetic - it is not within any `aes()` function and therefore is not mapped to any column.

# A common error  

.pull-left[

Aesthetic mappings like `fill=` and `color=` create "groups" in the plot. Problems arise if your data are "grouped", but your plot does not account for this. In other words: you have multiple "y" values per x-value.  

Below, `outcome_time_data` has one row per week-outcome, but the plotting command does not account for this.  



```r
outcome_time_data &lt;- linelist %&gt;% 
  group_by(died,
           week_onset = lubridate::floor_date(date_onset, "week")) %&gt;% 
  summarise(n_cases = n()) %&gt;%

  select(week_onset, everything()) %&gt;% 
  arrange(week_onset) %&gt;% 
  drop_na(week_onset)

outcome_time_data %&gt;%

# Scales - overview  

Scale commands control *how* the aesthetic mappings manifest, for example:  
* *Which* colors or shapes to display  
* The min/max of point sizes  
* The min/max and frequency of axes breaks  

To replace the defaults, add a `scale_` command. As a generic formula, these commands are written as: `scale_AESTHETIC_METHOD()`.  

1) `scale_` : this prefix never changes  
2) Aesthetics like: `_fill_` , `_color_` , `_x_` , `_y_` , etc.  
3) Methods like: `_continuous()`, `_discrete()`, `_manual()`, `_date()` etc.

Inside the command, use arguments such as `breaks=`, `values=`, or `labels=` (there are many possibilities).

# Scales examples

# Label tips  

See the [Epi R Handbook page](https://epirhandbook.com/characters-and-strings.html#dynamic-strings) on adjusting characters with the **stringr** package

**New lines**  
Use `\n` within the string to bump to a new line, or place the text in [`str_wrap()`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_wrap.html)


```r
title = "Top line\nNextline"                        # \n creates new line
title = str_wrap("This is a really long title", 30) # wrap at 30 characters
```


**Dynamic labels**  
Use `str_glue()` to imbed R code that updates with the data.  


```r
caption = str_glue("Data as of {Sys.Date()}")
```


```r
caption = str_glue("{nrow(linelist %&gt;% filter(is.na(date_onset)))} cases missing date of onset and not shown")
```

**Legend title**  
In `labs()`, write the aesthetic that created the legend, like `fill=`, `color=`, or `shape=`, and provide a title.

  * Fast, simple, and modifiable with ggplot additions  
  
2) Use ggplot's `geom_histogram()`  
  * Most customizeability  
  * Most complex code  

--

Today's demonstration will focus on **incidence2**.  

.footnote[See the Epi R handbook's [Epicurves page](https://epirhandbook.com/epidemic-curves.html) for detailed examples of both methods]

# Epicurve - make incidence object 

.pull-left[

Load **incidence2**  


```r
pacman::p_load(incidence2) # install/load
```

**Create** an incidence object from your dataset  


```r
weekly &lt;- incidence(
  x = linelist,            # define dataset
  date_index = date_onset, # date column
  interval = "week")       # bin interval   
```

**Plot** the incidence object  


```r
plot(weekly)
```

Adjust the interval


```r

  date_index = date_onset, # date column
* interval = "2 months")   # bin interval

**Plot** the incidence object  


```r
plot(bimonthly)

# Epicurve - groups 

.pull-left[

To add groups, specify them to `groups=` in the `incidence()` command:  


```r
weekly &lt;- incidence(
  x = linelist,              # define dataset
  date_index = date_onset,   # date column
  interval = "weeks",        # bin interval
* groups = eth_race)      
```

AND to `fill=` in the `plot()` command:  


```r
plot(weekly,
* fill = eth_race)
```

If grouping by multiple columns, nest them in both places within `c()`:  


```r
groups = c(eth_race, gender)
```

# Epicurve - missing values 

.pull-left[

Here, "Unknown" is a distinct value. To add `NA` (missing) values as their own group, use `na_as_group=TRUE`  


```r
weekly &lt;- incidence(
  x = linelist,            # define dataset
  date_index = date_onset, # date column
  interval = "weeks",      # bin interval
  groups = eth_race,
* na_as_group = TRUE)      # missing as group
```

# Epicurve - groups 


.pull-left[

Add other **ggplot2** commands with `+`.  


```r
plot(weekly, fill = eth_race)+
scale_y_continuous(
  expand = c(0,0),
  breaks = seq(0,2000,250))+
*scale_y_continuous(
* expand = c(0,0),
* breaks = seq(0,2000,250))+
*theme(legend.position = "top")+
*labs(fill = "Race and\nEthnicity")
```

]

.pull-right[



&lt;img src="slides_ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-79-1.png" width="504" /&gt;

---
# Epicurve - date axis 

.pull-left[


```r
plot(weekly,
  fill = eth_race,
*  date_format = "%a %d %b %Y\n (Week %W)", 
*  angle = 30)+                           # angle of date labels)+
scale_y_continuous(
  expand = c(0,0),
  breaks = seq(0,2000,250))+
theme(legend.position = "top")+
labs(fill = "Race and\nEthnicity")
```


Do adjust date axis with `scale_x_date()`. Instead, use custom **incidence2** arguments in `plot()`.

# Epicurve - show cases 

.pull-left[

For small outbreaks, the style `show_cases = TRUE` may be helpful:  


```r
zip30024 &lt;- incidence(
  x = linelist %&gt;% filter(zip == 30024), 
  date_index = date_onset,               
  interval = "Sunday weeks",             
  groups = eth_race)
```


```r
plot(zip30024,
  fill = eth_race,
* show_cases = TRUE)+
theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
labs(title = "COVID-19 cases in ZIP 30024")

# Epicurve - color palette 

.pull-left[

Try an **incidence2** color palette  



```r
plot(weekly,
  fill = eth_race, 
* col_pal = muted)

Note a palette is an *object* and so not in quotes.  

]

.pull-right[

# Epicurve - aggregated counts

# Demographic pyramids  

We suggest two ways to make age pyramids:  

1) Use the **apyramid** package - simple, easy  

2) Use **ggplot2** - more customizeable, but opportunity for error  

--

Today we will demonstrate **apyramid**.  

.footnote[See the Epi R Handbook [page on demographic pyramids](https://epirhandbook.com/demographic-pyramids-and-likert-scales.html) for more information on both.]

# Demographic pyramids

The function `age_pyramid()` from **apyramid** offers an easy interface:  

.pull-left[


```r
age_pyramid(
  data = linelist,
  age_group = "age_group",
  split_by = "gender")
```

Three `gender` values are detected, so the plot is not a traditional pyramid.

&lt;img src="slides_ggplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-92-1.png" width="504" /&gt;

# Demographic pyramids

Let's remove "Unknown" as an explicit category, by converting to `NA` and dropping the unused factor level:  


```r
linelist_2g &lt;- linelist %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    gender = na_if(gender, "Unknown"), # convert to NA 
    gender = fct_drop(gender))         # drop unused factor levels
```

`tabyl()` from **janitor** makes pretty tabulations


```r
linelist_2g %&gt;%
  tabyl(gender) %&gt;% 
  adorn_pct_formatting()
```

```
##  gender     n percent valid_percent
##  Female 43280   52.7%         53.0%
##    Male 38376   46.8%         47.0%

# Bar plots  

`geom_col()` and `geom_bar()` are used to make general bar plots (non-epicurves).

--

Use `geom_bar()` if bar height should reflect the number of rows in the data (e.g. a case linelist).  


```r
ggplot(linelist)+                        # begin with linelist       
*  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = eth_race)) # one bar per race/ethnicity. No y= argument. 
```

--

Use `geom_col()` if the data have a numeric column containing the desired bar height (i.e. aggregated count data).  


```r
ggplot(linelist_agg)+                             # begin with aggregated count data            
*  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = eth_race, y = n))   # bar height is value in column "n"

# Bar plots (adjust order)  

.pull-left[

Below, to order by frequency, `fct_infreq()` is applied to the x-axis column `eth_race` and the fill column `died`.


```r
ggplot(linelist)+          # begin with case linelist    
  geom_bar(                # column height by number of rows
    mapping = aes(
*     x = fct_infreq(eth_race),  # bars ordered by frequency 
*     fill = fct_infreq(died)))+ # stacks ordered by frequency
 coord_flip()              # flip x and y axes
```

You will need to clean up the legend title now, with `labs(fill=)`.

# Bar plots (reverse order)  

.pull-left[

To *reverse* bar order, use `fct_rev()` from the **forcats** package. It can be wrapped around other functions. 

The below reverses the previous frequency ordering from `fct_infreq()`.  



```r
ggplot(linelist)+              
  geom_bar(                
    mapping = aes(
*     x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(eth_race)),  # reverse frequency
*     fill = fct_rev(fct_infreq(died))))+ # reverse frequency      
 coord_flip()              
```

# Bar plot - display counts  

.pull-left[

To display text, add `geom_text()` with `aes(label=)` assigned to the height column.  

The `position=` arg in `geom_text()` can specify display at mid-bar.  


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist_eth_died,
  mapping = aes(
    x = eth_race,
    y = n,
    fill = died,
*   label = n))+             
geom_col()+
*geom_text(
* size = 3,
* position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))
```

.footnote[
Best to use `geom_col()` and not `geom_bar()` for this. Also, try `geom_label()` if you want a box around the text.

# Bar plot - adjust width  

.pull-left[

Adjust bar width with `width=`.  


```r
ggplot(
  data = linelist_eth_died,
  mapping = aes(
    x = eth_race,
    y = n,
    fill = died))+             
*geom_col(width = 0.5)+
```

Be wary of adjusting width for date bars (e.g. month) - use `geom_histogram()` instead with bin breaks.

# Bar plot - adjacent

    x = eth_race,
    y = n,

# Data structure  

**ggplot2** works best when the dataset is "long".  

IMAGE OF PIVOTING DATA

You have seen workarounds for aggregated data, such as `geom_col()` for bar plots. But for all other plots it is far easier to shape your data to conform to this structure prior to plotting.  

You should get familiar with `pivot_longer()` from **dyplr**. We cannot go in-depth in this presentation, but see the [Epi R Handbook pivoting page](https://epirhandbook.com/pivoting-data.html).

`scales::percent()` converts proportions into percents maintaining a numeric axis. If you otherwise add "%" the class will convert to character.

# Show groups  

So far the graph shows the distribution of cases in all hospitals. 

It would make sense to break down the visualization by hospitals.

Two options:  

* Fill each hospital in different color (stacked histogram)
* Create multiple plots, each showing a different hospital



---
# Color by group

.pull-left[

To color by group (stacked epicurve), we need to map the variable `eth_race` to the `fill=` aesthetic *in* the `aes()`:  


```r
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(
         x    = date_onset,
*        fill = eth_race))+
  geom_histogram()
```

Note: the _fill_ aesthetics control the color filling areas while the _color_ aesthetics control the color of lines and points.
