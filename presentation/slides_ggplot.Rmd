# About us  

## Providing R support for applied epis  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/epiRhandbook_eng/raw/master/images/Epi%20R%20Handbook%20Banner%20Beige%201500x500.png)

* We are a grassroots collaborative of applied epidemiologists  
* The (free) Epi R Handbook has been used by 40,000 people worldwide
* Now we offer customized training to health departments and NGOs

# Today's session   

Today is primarily *explanation* and *demonstration*, following from the previous [demonstration on data management and workflow](https://appliedepi.github.io/emory_training/presentation/slides.html).  

We assume you have reviewed the Handbook pages on [R Basics](https://epirhandbook.com/r-basics.html) and [ggplot basics](https://epirhandbook.com/ggplot-basics.html).  

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  




???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question & answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching.

[XXX: I find that one more readable (formatted text is always more readable than code to me) even though the other idea is more fun (if it was a written document I would vouch for it)]

---
# Setting the scene - directory structure  

Our R work is conducted within an **R project** - a folder that contains:  

* R markdown script(s)  
* a data folder  

```{r}
fs::dir_tree(path = here::here("case_study"), recurse = TRUE)
```

[XXX: I am not sure I would define an R project as a folder per se. It is more a special file that interacts well with the project structure. Alternate version: 

Our R work is conducted within a dedicated directory that contains:  

* An R project (optional but advised)
* Rmarkdown script(s)  
* a data folder]

---
# Load packages  

**ggplot2** is included within the **tidyverse** mega-package (read more [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).  

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            # import/export
  here,           # file locator
  rmarkdown,      # reports
  tidyverse       # mega-package for data management and visualization
  )
```

The **tidyverse** also includes these packages:  
* **dplyr** (data management)  
* **stringr** (characters and text)  
* **forcats** (factors / ordered categories)  
* and many others...  

---
# Import data

We use a *clean* dataset, to focus on visualization techniques.  

* Use `import()` function from **rio** to import an RDS file  
* Use `here()` function from **here** to locate the file relative to the R project root

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# This actually runs but is not displayed
linelist <- import(here::here("case_study", "data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
linelist <- import(here::here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

[1] A .rds file can store an R data frame and retain column classes  

---
# Review data  

Below are the first 25 rows of the linelist:  

```{r}
head(linelist, 25) %>% 
  DT::datatable(
    options = list(
      scrollY = 300,
      scrollX = 600,
      pageLength = 25,
      fontSize = '50%',
      dom = "ti",
      ordering = FALSE,
      rownames = FALSE,
      options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T),
      class = 'white-space: nowrap' 
    )
  )

  #knitr::kable(format = 'html')
```

# Visualization options in R  

- **base** R  
  + `plot()`, `boxplot()`, `hist()`  
- **ggplot2**  
  + `geom_bar()`, `geom_col()`, `geom_point()`...  
- **plotly**  
  + Interactive plots (e.g. zoom, hover text...)


?Plot examples from base R, ggplot, and plotly?

# Fundamentals of ggplot2



---
# gg-what?  

- The **ggplot2** *package* is the most popular data visualization tool in R  
- Its `ggplot()` *function* is at the core of the package  
- This whole approach is colloquially known as “ggploting”  
- Resulting figures are sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”  

**ggplot2** benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that further enhance its functionality, such as **gganimate**, **ggthemr**, **ggdendro**, **gghighlight**...  

[1] *Question for the audience: What does the "gg” in these names represent?*


???
- "gg" represents the “grammar of graphics” used to construct the figures 





---
# Opening the canvas (1)

.pull-left[

The base panel is formed by the `ggplot()` command  

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = linelist)
```
] 

.pull-right[
```{r }
ggplot(data = linelist)
```
]









---
# Geoms  

Geoms express the data as geometry (lines, points, boxplots, histograms, etc.)

Many **ggplot2** functions create “geoms”, including:  

* Histograms - geom_histogram()  
* Bar charts - geom_bar() or geom_col() (see “Bar plot” section)  
* Box plots - geom_boxplot()  
* Points - geom_point()  
* Line graphs - geom_line() or geom_path()  
* Trend lines - geom_smooth()  

In one plot you can display one or multiple geoms. Each is added to previous ggplot2 commands with a `+`, and they are plotted sequentially such that later geoms are plotted on top of previous ones









---
# Map columns to the data  

.pull-left[

*Map* the column `date_onset` to the x-axis   

```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = date_onset) #<<
    )
```
] 

.pull-right[
```{r }
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = date_onset)
    )
```
]

???
- Note about the work "aesthetics" and how its ggplot meaning is slightly different than in common English. It does not mean the trappings, but is specifically about the data that is being plotted in geometries (shapes) - not the surrounding background colors etc.



---
# Groups in the data  

.pull-left[

The show groups, use
```{r , echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = date_onset,
      fill = hospital #<<
      ) 
    )
```
] 

.pull-right[
```{r }
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(
      x = date_onset,
      fill = hospital
      )
    )
```
]

???
- Note about the work "aesthetics" and how its ggplot meaning is slightly different than in common English. It does not mean the trappings, but is specifically about the data that is being plotted in geometries (shapes) - not the surrounding background colors etc.

Where do the arguments go?  
`data = `
`mapping = aes()`  
`x = `  
`y = `
`fill = `

# Visualizing your data

There is a whole science to properly choosing *how* to visualize your data. We will only briefly touch upon this in the context of **ggplot2**  

---
# Distribution of one continuous column  


---
# Epidemic curves


---
# Demographic pyramids  


---
# Two continuous columns  


---
# Three continuous columns  

Heatplots, density plots


---
# One categorical column  

Inverted axes  


---
# Two categorical columns  

Heatplots

---
# Continuous by categorical groups  


---
# Facets/small-multiples


---
# Factors and ordering plots  


---
# Dynamics captions






---
# Header  
## This is a subheader


- Hello our name is 
  + blabla
  + blabla

# Sequential reveal of bullet points

You can reveal stuff bit by bit using to dashes between sections

# Tables with Knitr 

Tables need to be in HTML format  
So either Knitter or flextable

```{r knitr_tabble}
head(mtcars) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = 'html')
```

---

# Tables with Flextable 

You can colour in rows directly with flextable

```{r flextable}
head(mtcars) %>%
  flextable::flextable() %>% 
  flextable::bg(., 
        i = c(2, 4), 
        part = "body", 
        bg = "yellow")
```

---



# Table highlighting

- Use  chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output. 
  + For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines
  + `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.


```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(mtcars)
```

---

## Visualisation 

Note to selves: 
I think the way [this presentation](https://www.cedricscherer.com/slides/2019-08-28-intro-ggplot-statsizw#20) 
breaks down ggplots line by line is probably the way to go! 

---

## A ggplot code example

- see [extras slide](#references) for alt side-by-side option in twitter feed


.pull-left[

Highlight code lines using #<<

```{r ggplot_code, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +  #<<
  geom_smooth()   #<<
```
] 

.pull-right[
```{r ggplot_code_plot}
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + 
  ## NB have to fiddle with sizes a bit to make look good on output
  theme_gray(base_size = 24)
```

# Including images

.pull-left[
- Text displayed along side an image

  + position is %accross and %down 
  + size .... just flip a coin and see what comes out 
  + can also use % for images (see layout chunk just below YAML) 
    + i.e. in layout section up top to adds logos to each page (as per the twitter feed in [extras slide](#references))
- Can also include images with usual Rmarkdown or knitr code (e.g. next slide)

# Xaringan extra & fancy stuff 

- This is a good [tutorial](https://presentable-user2021.netlify.app/) from useR conference.
- You can include fancier code tabs i.e. this [pres](https://xaringan.gallery/examples.html) 
- Theres other fancy stuff in this [gallery](https://xaringan.gallery/examples.html)
- There is tips in this [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1085659933238976513)
  + e.g. if you name slides you can link back to them (nb. name needs to be first thing defined on slide)
  + keyboard shortcuts for presenting 
  + better side-by-side code example 
  + title page 
  + logos (have included this)
  + background images 
- Can set theme using [{xaringanthemer}](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer/articles/xaringanthemer.html) package 
  + seems easier than messing around with css

# Thanks!

Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).




---

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```


---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.


---

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).
