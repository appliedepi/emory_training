# Header  
## This is a subheader


- Hello our name is 
  + blabla
  + blabla

.footnote[
[1] Something _super_ important to say 

[2] Some **other** stuff 

[3] bla
]


???

- I think these are presenter notes 
- You can see them in presenter mode 
  + Keyboard shortcut is 'p'

# Sequential reveal of bullet points

You can reveal stuff bit by bit using to dashes between sections 

--

- This is my first point

- Then I move on to this fascinating point

- And finish with this blabla

# Tables with Knitr 

Tables need to be in HTML format  
So either Knitter or flextable

```{r knitr_tabble}
head(mtcars) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = 'html')
```

---

# Tables with Flextable 

You can colour in rows directly with flextable

```{r flextable}
head(mtcars) %>%
  flextable::flextable() %>% 
  flextable::bg(., 
        i = c(2, 4), 
        part = "body", 
        bg = "yellow")
```

---



# Table highlighting

- Use  chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output. 
  + For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines
  + `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.


```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(mtcars)
```

---

## Visualisation 

Note to selves: 
I think the way [this presentation](https://www.cedricscherer.com/slides/2019-08-28-intro-ggplot-statsizw#20) 
breaks down ggplots line by line is probably the way to go! 

---

## A ggplot code example

- see [extras slide](#references) for alt side-by-side option in twitter feed


.pull-left[

Highlight code lines using #<<

```{r ggplot_code, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +  #<<
  geom_smooth()   #<<
```
] 

.pull-right[
```{r ggplot_code_plot}
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + 
  ## NB have to fiddle with sizes a bit to make look good on output
  theme_gray(base_size = 24)
```

# Including images

.pull-left[
- Text displayed along side an image 
- May need to fiddle with sizes
  + position is %accross and %down 
  + size .... just flip a coin and see what comes out 
  + can also use % for images (see layout chunk just below YAML) 
    + i.e. in layout section up top to adds logos to each page (as per the twitter feed in [extras slide](#references))
- Can also include images with usual Rmarkdown or knitr code (e.g. next slide)

# Xaringan extra & fancy stuff 

- You can include fancier code tabs i.e. this [pres](https://xaringan.gallery/examples.html) 
- Theres other fancy stuff in this [gallery](https://xaringan.gallery/examples.html)
- There is tips in this [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1085659933238976513)
  + e.g. if you name slides you can link back to them (nb. name needs to be first thing defined on slide)
  + keyboard shortcuts for presenting 
  + better side-by-side code example 
  + title page 
  + logos (have included this)
  + background images 
- Can set theme using [{xaringanthemer}](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer/articles/xaringanthemer.html) package 
  + seems easier than messing around with css

# Keyboard shortcuts when presenting

Press `h` or `?` to see the possible ninjutsu you can use in remark.js.

# Thanks!

Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

# Some Tips

- The title slide is created automatically by **xaringan**, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.

    The title slide is set to `class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide` by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the `titleSlideClass` option of `nature` (`title-slide` is always applied).

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]
    ```
    
--

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```


---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.


---

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
```

If you want to contribute a theme to **xaringan**, please read [this blog post](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes).
